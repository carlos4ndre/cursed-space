# Cursed Space

Hey There!

If you are reading this chances are that you might be interested in playing this game, let me warn you, it is completly useless and filled with evil aliens, asteroids and black holes. Not scared yet? Great! Hope you have a good time playing this game.

This game was entirely developed with ncurses! The bleeding edge graphical API :P

Enjoy the game!
